## Introduction
Code Solutions allows you to save issues that you face while coding. You can categorize each issue based on the topic and you can then add solutions which will be tied to each issue.

## Use Case
Why is the app useful? As developers, we face many issues. We tend to search Google and find a solution. Many of us might add the URL to our bookmarks, but having a large number of them will lead to difficulties in finding what we are looking for. With Code Solutions, you can find what you are looking for and unlike with bookmarks, you can tie each solution to a specific issue.

The app is responsive and will scale with different size devices.

## Technical
* The app is built using React. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS and React. Application state is managed through Redux and the backend uses NodeJS with ExpressJS.
* The app is fully responsive, adapting for mobile, table and desktop viewports.
* Routing is handled using React-Router Hash History.
* Responsive Grid, Buttons and various other components used from React-Bootstrap.

## Upcoming Features
* Allow users to interact by allowing them to suggest solutions to other users.
* Search issues by topic.
* Broaden the theme of the app. Allow the same features for other topics.
